## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **OpenAI API Key**: [Create an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- **LangCache API**: [Get LangCache credentials](https://redis.io/langcache/)

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/Redish.git
cd Redish
```

### Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the root:

```bash
APP_NAME="Redish"
SERVER_PORT=3000

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string

LANGCACHE_API_KEY="your_langcache_api_key"
LANGCACHE_API_BASE_URL="your_langcache_api_base_url"
LANGCACHE_CACHE_ID="your_langcache_cache_id"

MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"

# For tracing with Langsmith
LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="your_langsmith_endpoint"
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="your_langsmith_project"

```

üìù Make sure to replace these placeholders with your real values before running the app.

### Option 1: Manual installation

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Node.js (v18 or higher)**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Redis**: You can either:
  - Install Redis locally: [Redis installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)
  - Use Docker: `docker run --name redish-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:8.0`
  - Use [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io) (no installation required)

#### ‚úÖ Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Load sample grocery data:
   ```bash
   npm run load-products
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: üê≥ Run with Docker Compose

Skip manual setup and run everything using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Access the app

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser (or use the port specified in `.env`).

## AI Features

- **Recipe Ingredients**: Ask for ingredients for any recipe and get suggested products
- **Product Search**: Find products by name, category, or description
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI suggests alternatives and complementary items
- **Cart Management**: Add, remove, and view cart items through natural conversation

## Technical features

- **Semantic Cache**: Similar queries return instantly using LangCache
- **Vector Search**: Find products using AI-powered similarity search
- **Redis as memory layer**: for fast data retrieval
- **LangGraph Workflows**:  AI agent routing, tool selection
- **Multi-tool Agent**: Recipe tools, search tools, cart tools, and knowledge tools

---

## Architecture


The grocery agent uses a LangGraph-powered AI agent that routes requests through specialized tools:

1. **Cache Check**: First checks Redis semantic cache for similar queries
2. **AI Agent**: Routes to appropriate tools based on request type
3. **Specialized Tools**: Recipe ingredients, product search, cart operations, direct answers
4. **Services Layer**: Product, cart, and chat services
5. **Redis Storage**: Vector embeddings, semantic cache, and session data

---

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/chat` - Main chat interface for AI shopping assistant
- `GET /api/products/search` - Search products with text/vector similarity
- `POST /api/cart/add` - Add items to shopping cart
- `GET /api/cart` - View cart contents
- `DELETE /api/cart` - Clear cart
